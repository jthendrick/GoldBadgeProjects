"# GoldBadgeProjects" 
Hello, and thank you for taking the time to look at my programs! We will go over the functionality of each program and how they can be useful!

'Cafe' project:
With the Cafe program, are able to add new menu items to your database! 
You are also able to search for menu items by their name for fast ordering with a large selection of meals!
Tired of a menu item or it isnt too popular? Well, you can just delete the item and never worry about it again with our program!
Lastly, you are able to neatly display all items in your arsenal with one key stroke to make sure you have everything up to date!

'Claims' project:
You own an insurance company? Well I have the program for you!
With my program you are able to see all of your current claims with all of the relevant information. (ID, Type, Description, Date of incident, Date of claim, nad if it is valid)
You are able to manually enter a new claim as well as they come in to your office. 
Lastly, you are able to remove a claim from the queue so you can start promptly start on the claim. 

'Badge' project:
Got alot of door that you dont want people to see behind? Boy-o-boy do i have a program for you!
With the Badge program you are able to create badges that have editable door accesses tied to them. 
And of course, you are able to see all of your active badges and what doors they can open with one keystroke!

There was alot of blood, sweat, and tears that went into these programs, I hope you enjoy them and they bring your business to the next level!
